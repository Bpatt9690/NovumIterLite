# NovumIter Lite

Welcome to the NovumIter Lite repository! This repository contains the source code for a Python-based home rover project. NovumIter Lite is designed to provide a lightweight and versatile rover platform that can be easily controlled and customized for various home automation and monitoring tasks.

## Features

NovumIter Lite offers the following key features:

1. **Rover Control**: The repository provides a comprehensive set of Python scripts that enable you to control the rover's movement, including driving, turning, and stopping.
2. **Sensors Integration**: The rover is equipped with various sensors such as ultrasonic, infrared, and camera modules. The code in this repository enables you to interface with these sensors, read data, and perform actions based on sensor inputs.
3. **Video Streaming**: NovumIter Lite includes functionality for streaming live video from the rover's camera module. You can easily configure and access the video feed from a remote device.
4. **Remote Control**: The repository contains code for establishing a remote control connection to the rover, allowing you to control its movement and access sensor data from a separate device.
5. **Modular Architecture**: NovumIter Lite is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and add new functionality. Each component is designed to be independent and reusable.

## Setup and Usage

To use NovumIter Lite, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NovumIter-Lite.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Connect the hardware components (e.g., sensors, camera module) to your rover following the instructions provided with your hardware.

5. Modify the configuration files (`config.py`, `sensor_config.py`) to match your hardware setup and preferences.

6. Run the main control script to start the rover:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

7. Depending on your setup, you can access the rover remotely by connecting to its IP address and port.

8. Explore the available scripts and modules to customize the rover's behavior and functionality according to your project requirements.
